#ProjectIdea <br>
For the final project, I'll be conducting data analysis on one of my favorite cricket players (a sport that I regularly follow), Virat Kohli. Viral Kohli is a true game changer, and I've been following him since his first cricket match in 2011. The goal of this project is to evaluate his performance. I have the dataset in the form of a csv file, which contains statistics demonstrating his performance on the pitch. My dataset includes the following features:

1. Runs: In-game runs
2. BF: Match balls encountered
3. 4s: the number of 4s in a game.
4. 6s: the number of 6s in a game.
5. Strike Rate (SR) in the match
6. Position: Batting

I want to dive deep into his performance and find out some interesting insights - like which opponents does he like to play against the most, his favorite batting positions, how does he get out and how frequently does he remain not out. Additionally, I would like to find out how his strike rate varies between first and second innings. For now, these are the questions on the top of my head but I am sure that as I dive into this analysis, more and more questions will come to my mind. For the analysis in this project, I would probably use python packages like pandas and matplotlib.
