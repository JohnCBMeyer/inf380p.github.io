### How did it go?
I attended the Austin Data Science Python Meetup on 15 November and it was a very good learning experience for me. I want to explore the python third-party library and I chose the 'pandas' because that library is mostly used in the data science.
They not only covered the theory but also encouraging everyone to be hands on as much as possible.


### What did you learn?

I found the dataset of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and used pandas for following things:-

- create DataFrame
- Preprocess the data
- Handle missing values
- resizing or modification of rows and columns


### Would you find value in this kind of event after class?

Yes. Because my basics of python and programming was already covered so I went overboard and implemented the following things on the dataset also:-

- Interesting relationships between data fields in the data.
- The stats about the percentage of datapoints in the population that have graduated college.
- The relationship between Education Level (DMDEDUC2) and Ratio of family income to poverty (INDFMPIR).


### How was the experience different from your expectations?
I learned a lot not only about pandas but also the other libraries used in the ML like TensorFlow, Sci-Kit Learn.


### Could you see yourself becomming a member of a professional community like this in the future?
OfCourse! I like to explore more about the Python and what we can do just by writing few lines of code.
