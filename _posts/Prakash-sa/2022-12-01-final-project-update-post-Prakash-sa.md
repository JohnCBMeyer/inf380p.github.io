### Are there any roadblocks ahead? Is there anything your group can do to help out?
I am working on web scrapping, my major roadblock is extracting the stocks and companies from the HTML format. 

### Are your milestones ambitious enough? Make sure to include some stretch goals.
I believe my milestone is ambitious. I have used the BeautifulSoup to extract the required data from the HTML format and then use core python skills to extract the data further. The stretch goal is to code from scratch to extract data and display it according to the user input.

### Are your milestones too ambitious? Make sure to break down the unglamorous parts of coding into chunks that reflect the actual work to be done.
My goals are a little ambitious. I extracted the stocks of the companies according to the country. The link of the stocks of the country changes by their name, so I have to build the function to get the URL for that.

- First, I coded the function that is used most in web scrapping and made a new file for that.
- Second, I figured out the format of the stocks appearing in the HTML format by using the python skills like print, type, etc.
- Once that is done, I intend to save the stocks of the country in the CSV file.

- [x] Get the data.
- [x] Extract the data from the HTML
- [x] Design and implement the interface for the stock market
- [x] Implement the different analysis as functions in the program
- [x] Integrate them all in the main interface.
- Save the Stock market data in the CSV file.

### Are you able to keep to your plan? Looking back at what youâ€™ve actually done, is the difference accountable to bad planning (i.e. not anticipating what needed to be done), bad execution (not doing it), or something else?
It's pretty hard to extract the data from HTML format and display it on the console. I struggled a lot in finding the datatype in the HTML format and extracting that data. I am trying to use the python core feature more than third party library, so I have to make my functions to extract the data.
From this project, I got better at writing functions, debugging, importing functions from another file, getting the input, and extracting the data from the raw.
