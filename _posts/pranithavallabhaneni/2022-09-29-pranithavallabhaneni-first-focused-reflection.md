## First focused Reflection
I'm going to share my experiences which are fun,challenging and meaningful during my first in class- exercise, assignments and in my readings.

My first class was really interesting and the fun piece I had experienced during my very first turtle exercise was guiding the turtle by giving directions , creating squares and triangles and I realised that we can do wonders with the coding.

I can't say frustating but I've experienced little trouble during my readings is *math module* and during *parameters and arguments*.I don't expect sin or cos values to be known for a programmer,although we do need a little math in coding I agree and I tried to solve it initially and ultimately end up using google.
```
import math

signal_power = 10
noise_power = 10
ratio = signal_power / noise_power
decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)
print(decibels)

radians = 0.7
height = math.sin(radians)
print(height)
``` 

A lot of programming involves trail and error and it's terrible way to program and I'll try in all the possible ways untill I acheive the correct solution and at this stage textbook helped me alot.I realised that debugging is an important part of process.

Initial challanges that I faced during my practice sessions are **syntax errors** .I end up making syntactical errors in my program like not using periods,quotations etc and when I run my program that time I'll end up getting errors.Later on when I keep on practicing I got a grip on my errors and I tried not repeating them.
Over all textbook helped me alot in understanding all the desired functions with exercises and related examples.

Here is the link of the very first code that I've written.
