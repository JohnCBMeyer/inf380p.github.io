# INF first focused-reflection

This is my first Turtle python code!

In the first-in-class activity, I was surprised that I could draw a shape with the turtle. Moreover, if I changed the code, the behavior of the turtle would also be different. One frustrating thing is the trinket does not support Safari, and thus some of my code did not save correctly. One solution for this issue is using another browser, such as Chrome.

Another exciting thing I learned from this course is the usage of github. The professor teach as how to use pull-request and merge.

One interesting thing I want to explore is if I can change the turtle to another customized animal or image.
