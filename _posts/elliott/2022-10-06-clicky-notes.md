# Announcements

* If your program "doesn't work", begin describing exactly how. As you write this down, you'll get new ideas and you might solve the problem
* If your program often "doesn't work", perhaps you need to **Run** your code more often. 
* If your posts aren't showing, don't worry. We'll clean them up soon.

# Vocab + Q&A
* What should I make sure to cover?



# Part I: Merge a partner's Clicky turtlehack

You know the drill.  Pair up, merge up, confirm the file is visible on the site. If not, work together to determine why. Take a break once all partners' work is displaying on the site. Reconvene at the agreed-upon time.

**If you have changes requested on your other pull requests, address them during a break**

## Clicky Turtle Discussion

First, let's review the [starter code]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/clicky-turtles.html).

Then, in _new_ pairs, play with and discuss each other's work!


**If you have changes requested on your other pull requests, address them during a break**

# Part II: Group up & Make a Name For Yourself

Our class website runs off of a config file.  Time to tell us who you are (or want to be known as).

Reminder: your public activities in this class can be pseudonymous if you want them to be. You can, but don't have to, include personal information in your bio, display name, and links.

First: let's have a demo!

It's [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/make-a-name-for-yourself.html)

Your groups are for you to help each other on this exercise.

# Looking Ahead

Textbook time! Chapter 6 is on **Loops**.

This is a *definite* loop:

~~~python
for i in range(5):
    print("This will definitely print 5 times.")
~~~

This is an *indefinite loop:

~~~python
import random
while True:
    if random.random() > 0.5:
        break
    else:
        print("There's a 50% chance this will print each iteration of the loop ")
