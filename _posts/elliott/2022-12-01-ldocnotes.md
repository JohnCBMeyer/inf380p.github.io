If you'd like to work together or ask questions, I'll be in our class Zoom from 12 - 3pm. Here's a rough schedule, but I'll adapt to whoever shows up:

* 12pm: Turtlers
* 1pm: Analysts
* 2pm: Github/pull request help

Also, if you would like to work in a breakout room with a classmate during this time I'll be able to set that up for you.

Happy Thanksgiving!
