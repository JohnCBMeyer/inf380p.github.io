# Welcome to our new Teaching Assistant Misha Coleman

Misha has several years of professional programming experience, and has seen the benefits of a supportive technical community firsthand. We're lucky to have her!

# Feedback Form

Thanks for your considered feedback! It's very helpful and there are several things that I'll update in response to your comments.

What's Going Well
* "Focusing on the collaborative side of programming as well as the programming itself is what I really appreciate."
* "I love that you always ask for feedback regarding the readings and any issues or concerns that we may have."
* "Explaining the glossaries"

Your Time Management
* "Spending more time outside of class on assignments"
* "I need to get better at managing my schedule."
* "Managing time and engaging with the material more"

How the class can improve:
* "I might want more feedback on my trinket homework."
* "I think I'd retain more and things would make more sense discussing with peers/ instructor more than once a week."
* "At the beginning of class you usually have a vocab/concept roundup and list them on and try to pepper them in throughout the lecture. However, you usually only manage to get around half of them in..."
* "Making sure instructions are clear"
* "I think it would be helpful seeing you work through a few problems in class to give us an example of what you want to see."

Overall:
* "I really like this class and think it's going great."
* "The class is going well, I enjoy learning and like the environment you foster and promote."
* "It's going alright, but I can't deny the fact that I am terrified of the final project and the midterm and all of that."

Remote vs In Person
* Most students said that remote classes were effective
* Some noted issues with their lockdown study environments, and that it was helpful to see other people and get into a new space (I agree!)

Any other thoughts or things we should discuss as a group?

# September 30th we will be Remote

You're **welcome** to come use the classroom during our schdeuled time if that helps you have a clear time and place to work. Please **reach out** if there's anything I can do to help regarding your situation.

We will revisit the modality of October 14th, our next scheduled in-person class, closer to that date.

The class will *not* change its registration status from hybrid, regardless of what modality we use for the rest of the semester. In other words, you will continue to have a class with a formal in-person component.

# Recommended Reading

With many concepts, our text doesn't explain as much as [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/) does; check that
link for more info on **return values**, **scope**, and any other concepts that don't click for you.

# Questions & Answers

General:
* **Drafts** & **Saving in Trinket** - 1) Make a Copy of a trinket if you want to revise it! 2) make sure you press Save after editing, especially if you've already embedded it somewhere.
* I make mistakes and forget things! It's always OK to remind me or ask questions.
* Use my office hours! And ask me if I need to open up more space.

Left over from last time:
* What's the deal with `i` in `for i in range(4)`?
* What are *hashes*? What's a SHA-1 hash?
* Anything else?

# Peer Code Review

This is where those of you who have been commenting, reflecting, and pull request titling will
win friends because of it.  And if the purpose for and audience of these hasn't quite sunk in yet, reading
other people's code is the best way for it to.

# Part I - ~30m
Pair up via Zoom breakouts

* **Request a Review** from your partner
* **Assign** your partner's pull request to yourself in response to their request for review
* **Review** your partner's PR (using **Request Changes** if needed)
* **Merge** your partner's PR once it looks ready
* View their live post on the site
* *If you or your partner's post doesn't display*, work together to diagnose what is wrong about it: the filename, folders, YAML header, etc. If you can't figure this out, **Ask for Help** via zoom and we'll drop in.
* Take a break when you're done. Misha and I will pop in to help and stragglers.

Reconvene at the agreed time for Part II.

# Part II

On your own (~30m) :
* Fill out the [Turtle Peer Review](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvBOTEVgWOxTv0lOgl513beHZksdebOlQSH7m6th43JzEQkQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) form.
* Submit the form. Your partner will get a copy of your feedback after I review it.
* Take a break when you're done.

Back in new breakout groups at the agreed time: (~30m)
* Show off the partner you reviewed's code to the group
* Discuss the differnces between programs with your new partner(s)
* What did you you learn from reviewing others' code?

# Part III
All together at the agreed time:
* Show off a partner's work in front of class (~30m)


# Looking Ahead

Major projects coming up soon!

* Clicky turtlehack: Due Oct 7th
* Reflection on the class so far: Due Oct 7th
* Blackjack text game or Turtle Drawing App: Due Oct 28th
* Final Project due Dec 11th

The latter two will have intermediate assignments which will help you scope them out.

# Next Time

Lots of work for next week!  Pace yourself.  Start early.  We've got to keep going so we don't fall behind.

* Chapter 5 reading & exercises.  We'll *finally* go over loops!  Woot.
* Chapter 6 reading & exercises.  **Strings** aka text.  Super fun.
* Chapter 8 reading & exercises.  Lists.  Super useful!
* Recommended: Automate the Boring Stuff Lists and loops.

Why cram all these together?  Well, they're related.  Loops are loops **over** a list.  The familiar `range(4)` produces a list.  `for i in range(4)` produces the list `[0,1,2,3]`, assign each of them to `i` and completes the code in the for block.

Strings are just lists of characters, with additional methods (like `.format()` and `.contains()`) built in for our convenience.

So, it's a lot of material, but doing it all at once should help it all sink in. And, of course, we'll revisit them again and again, unpacking the layers.

# Flex time

*If you have posts that aren't showing up on the people page*, we'll walk through some examples of how to fix this.
