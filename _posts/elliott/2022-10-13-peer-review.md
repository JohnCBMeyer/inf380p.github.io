## Announcements

* We slowed down this past week, and we'll be slow this coming week again. Use this time to catch up, review notes, recordings, or your text.
* About half of the class seems to not have done the reading this week. If you're not doing readings...why? 


## Vocab + Q&A

* What should I make sure to cover in class?


# Feedback Form

Summary of the 10 or so responses (so far) to my optional feedback form.

**Elliott: Going Well**
* Like the in-class examples and modeling of skills & attitudes
* Classes are encouraging, well-structured and engaging
* "I really appreciated that the lectures are recorded so I can revisit parts I was confused on"
* Discussion is a good format. Some students asked for more of that.

**Elliott: Could Be Improved**
* Time management. Some classses go long.
* Would appreciate more open-ended challenges.
* Clearer expectations on where we should be at different parts of the class.
* Assignments roadmap would help with planning

**Elliott: Mixed**
* Github. Some students appreciate the content. Others feel it detracts from learning programming. Let me address this, briefly.
* "I'm not a huge fan of the github system, but I do understand that it is a reality of the profession, so that's not likely something I can change or escape, I'll just have to live with it."

**You: Doing Well**
* Experimenting with code
* Making fun programs
* Curiosity, excitement
* Adjusting to pace, workload, rhythms

**You: Could Be Improved** 
* Writing programs that are too complex or ambitious (starting small and building up is a key skill!)
* Falling behind due to taking too detailed notes (calibrating levels of resolution of understanding is a key skill!)
* Could be more creative with the open-ended parts


**Overall:**
* "Explaining more critical concepts in the class would be great" - let's talk! Which concepts are critical? How do you know? How do I know?
* "sometimes the super open assignments stress me out"
* "students who are new to coding feel overwhelmed and "behind" other classmates" - I know this may feel true - is it? What is 'behind'?
 

**Remote**

Overall: Decent, Nice change, not as effective
* positive on screensharing & breakouts. 
* difficult to pay attention

Suggestions:
* Put up whiteboard-style screen instead of gallery for discussions

**In Person**

* "forcing people to get up and talk to new people is good"
* "Being able to see you lecture in person helps me stay focused and learn new information better. I like when you use the whiteboard to incorporate student's questions in our learning process too."
* "it's hard to describe -- but in-person sessions are better in terms of getting to know my classmates."
* "I really appreciate the in-person real-time feedback on our codes when we do partner work."


## An Analogy

I'm teaching you the World Map of Python. We're touching on major continents, oceans, what lakes and rivers *are*, etc., and talking about major countries. You don't yet know much about specific places, unless you already knew something about them. If your classmates happen to know a lot about a specific area, or the 10 tallest mountains in the world: great! That says nothing about how well you're doing learning to use maps. The skills I'm teaching you will result in knowledge, but much more importantly the ability to use and understand maps as a source of future knowledge. Someone who happens to know a lot about Austin may or may not have the ability to learn a lot about Lahore or achieve a goal with a new map. I want everyone to have that ability by the end of the semester.

Github is a place where maps are made. You'll want to make and/or use maps, and you'll use Github for both. 

Out of analogy mode, I focus on _process_ because learning programming is never done, and, like a map, you might remember the outlines but it's impossible to remember all the details. If you use something a lot you'll remember most of the details. If you're good at picking up and using code then you'll be able to quickly learn the relevant details of a new area.

# Loops

**Loops are awesome for controlling the flow of your program!**

Only 50% of students did the readings :(

If you didn't do the readings and have lots of questions and confusions, please yield the floor to your classmates who put in that effort.

* Activity: 6.11.11
* Activity: 5.36.4


<h1>Strings: Introduction to your reading</h1>
<p>Strings we know and love. We've been using them since day one. But they have hidden superpowers!</p>
<p>Strings are quite important kinds of data, <strong>since they can encode so much of what we care about as humans</strong>.</p>
<p>In this reading, you'll learn about&nbsp;<strong>methods. </strong>Methods are things that objects of a certain type in Python can do, by themselves, <strong>because of that type</strong>. Some things to flag for you at the outset:</p>
<p>Strings can change their case via the <code>.upper()</code> and <code>.lower()</code> methods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Methods are <strong>called</strong> with the familiar <code>()</code> used in function calls. (In fact, methods are technically called <em>method functions</em>. They're not a kind of <strong>function</strong> in Python, instead part of what <strong>classes</strong> can give to the <strong>objects</strong> they create, but they're conceptually similar.)</p>
<p>If <code>mystring</code> is a variable, we call its methods using <strong>dot notation</strong>, for example <code>mystring.upper()</code>. <strong>Note the . here and when I wrote about <code>.upper()</code> and <code>.lower()</code> above.</strong> This is key to writing about methods, and to distinguishing them from functions in your writing.</p>


# Make a name for yourself

Let's complete this activity together.

# Part II: Group up & Make a Name For Yourself

Our class website runs off of a config file.  Time to tell us who you are (or want to be known as).

Reminder: your public activities in this class can be pseudonymous if you want them to be. You can, but don't have to, include personal information in your bio, display name, and links.

First: let's have a demo!

It's [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/make-a-name-for-yourself.html)

Your groups are for you to help each other on this exercise.

**If you have changes requested on your other pull requests, address them during a break**


# Feedback Form

Thanks for your considered feedback! It's very helpful and there are several things that I'll update in response to your comments.

What's Going Well
* "Focusing on the collaborative side of programming as well as the programming itself is what I really appreciate."
* "I love that you always ask for feedback regarding the readings and any issues or concerns that we may have."
* "Explaining the glossaries"

Your Time Management
* "Spending more time outside of class on assignments"
* "I need to get better at managing my schedule."
* "Managing time and engaging with the material more"

How the class can improve:
* "I might want more feedback on my trinket homework."
* "I think I'd retain more and things would make more sense discussing with peers/ instructor more than once a week."
* "At the beginning of class you usually have a vocab/concept roundup and list them on and try to pepper them in throughout the lecture. However, you usually only manage to get around half of them in..."
* "Making sure instructions are clear"
* "I think it would be helpful seeing you work through a few problems in class to give us an example of what you want to see."

Overall:
* "I really like this class and think it's going great."
* "The class is going well, I enjoy learning and like the environment you foster and promote."
* "It's going alright, but I can't deny the fact that I am terrified of the final project and the midterm and all of that."

Remote vs In Person
* Most students said that remote classes were effective
* Some noted issues with their lockdown study environments, and that it was helpful to see other people and get into a new space (I agree!)

Any other thoughts or things we should discuss as a group?

# September 30th we will be Remote

You're **welcome** to come use the classroom during our schdeuled time if that helps you have a clear time and place to work. Please **reach out** if there's anything I can do to help regarding your situation.

We will revisit the modality of October 14th, our next scheduled in-person class, closer to that date.

The class will *not* change its registration status from hybrid, regardless of what modality we use for the rest of the semester. In other words, you will continue to have a class with a formal in-person component.

# Recommended Reading

With many concepts, our text doesn't explain as much as [Automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter3/) does; check that
link for more info on **return values**, **scope**, and any other concepts that don't click for you.

# Questions & Answers

General:
* **Drafts** & **Saving in Trinket** - 1) Make a Copy of a trinket if you want to revise it! 2) make sure you press Save after editing, especially if you've already embedded it somewhere.
* I make mistakes and forget things! It's always OK to remind me or ask questions.
* Use my office hours! And ask me if I need to open up more space.

Left over from last time:
* What's the deal with `i` in `for i in range(4)`?
* What are *hashes*? What's a SHA-1 hash?
* Anything else?

# Peer Code Review

This is where those of you who have been commenting, reflecting, and pull request titling will
win friends because of it.  And if the purpose for and audience of these hasn't quite sunk in yet, reading
other people's code is the best way for it to.

# Part I - ~30m
Pair up via Zoom breakouts

* **Request a Review** from your partner
* **Assign** your partner's pull request to yourself in response to their request for review
* **Review** your partner's PR (using **Request Changes** if needed)
* **Merge** your partner's PR once it looks ready
* View their live post on the site
* *If you or your partner's post doesn't display*, work together to diagnose what is wrong about it: the filename, folders, YAML header, etc. If you can't figure this out, **Ask for Help** via zoom and we'll drop in.
* Take a break when you're done. Misha and I will pop in to help and stragglers.

Reconvene at the agreed time for Part II.

# Part II

On your own (~30m) :
* Fill out the [Turtle Peer Review](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvBOTEVgWOxTv0lOgl513beHZksdebOlQSH7m6th43JzEQkQ/viewform?usp=sf_link) form.
* Submit the form. Your partner will get a copy of your feedback after I review it.
* Take a break when you're done.

Back in new breakout groups at the agreed time: (~30m)
* Show off the partner you reviewed's code to the group
* Discuss the differnces between programs with your new partner(s)
* What did you you learn from reviewing others' code?

# Part III
All together at the agreed time:
* Show off a partner's work in front of class (~30m)


# Looking Ahead

Major projects coming up soon!

* Clicky turtlehack: Due Oct 7th
* Reflection on the class so far: Due Oct 7th
* Blackjack text game or Turtle Drawing App: Due Oct 28th
* Final Project due Dec 11th

The latter two will have intermediate assignments which will help you scope them out.

# Next Time

Lots of work for next week!  Pace yourself.  Start early.  We've got to keep going so we don't fall behind.

* Chapter 5 reading & exercises.  We'll *finally* go over loops!  Woot.
* Chapter 6 reading & exercises.  **Strings** aka text.  Super fun.
* Chapter 8 reading & exercises.  Lists.  Super useful!
* Recommended: Automate the Boring Stuff Lists and loops.

Why cram all these together?  Well, they're related.  Loops are loops **over** a list.  The familiar `range(4)` produces a list.  `for i in range(4)` produces the list `[0,1,2,3]`, assign each of them to `i` and completes the code in the for block.

Strings are just lists of characters, with additional methods (like `.format()` and `.contains()`) built in for our convenience.

So, it's a lot of material, but doing it all at once should help it all sink in. And, of course, we'll revisit them again and again, unpacking the layers.

# Flex time

*If you have posts that aren't showing up on the people page*, we'll walk through some examples of how to fix this.
