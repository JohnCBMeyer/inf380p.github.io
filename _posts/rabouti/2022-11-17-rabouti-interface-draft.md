title: "Final Project Update Interface Draft"

It’s been rather difficult for me to decide which direction I want to go with my game and most of my visions have been overly ambitious. Therefore, I have had to adjust my expectations and plans in order to come up with an original game that exemplifies my abilities (i.e., efficacy) and satisfies all of the project requirements. 

I finally decided to pursue a treasure hunt game. My new plan is to create a game where the user selects a door and each door corresponds to a “realm” - each realm varies in difficulty and the user must find where the “golden goose" is hiding in each realm (i.e., the treasure). I would like each realm to have a riddle for the user to solve before embarking on the "golden goose" chase.

Upon the user's selection, Python will ask a riddle in order to print a “realm” that corresponds to each “door.” Before entering each door/realm, the user will have to solve a riddle. With click events, the user will click various objects to unveil where the “golden goose” is hiding. When the user finds the goose, then they can “win” in that realm and obtain one bar of gold. In order to "win," you must collect 3 bars of gold from the goose in each realm. Upon correctly finding the gold, you will go back to the main screen and select another door to keep adding to your score until you "win."

Currently, the roadblocks ahead include figuring out how to execute code that appropriately matches the intended results and outcomes and using the correct order of operations - and just staying on top of everything while being organized and efficient. Additionally, I need to learn how to load images to Python and intentionally weave images into my program.

I’m still tweaking all of the details and am excited to further develop my plans. Unfortunately, I still think my plan is slightly too ambitious, so I am still making adjustments and evolving how I want to bring my ideas to fruition. 

######Here is an initial sketch I made and have plans to add to:

I plan to weave in Dr. Hauser's code from the class website to construct a program with "treasure hunt" features. Under each line of code where the program "prints" after the user selects which door, I plan to "print" a background screen with all of the features I want in the corresponding door's "realm." 

Being in a group will be helpful in the event that I have questions regarding varying potentialities about my game.
