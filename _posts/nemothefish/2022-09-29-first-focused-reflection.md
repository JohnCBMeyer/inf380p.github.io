I am a literature major and i have found that the physical act of writing code requires some getting used to since it's extremely meticulous. Over time, I have gotten 
better about visualizing geometric shapes for my drawings or requisite commands for text-based algorithms. In this post, I will link a trinket I am currently working on
which eventually will allow the user to choose the weather they want to see drawn on-screen. Up till now, I have been mostly hardcoding objects but I have also created
some loops which I will supplement with some if-else statements, which I realized make drawings much more convenient. 

Although programming doesn't directly relate to my intended field of specialization (UX/UI), I think it will help me put things in perspective from the programmers
working on my team in the future.
