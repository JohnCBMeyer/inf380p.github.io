title: Rosalind Bradshaw's Final Project Plan
---

For my final project I am planning on coding a turtle game. The game will be an adventure maze that the player will explore and navigate using clicks.

Some initial milestones will be:
  - Successively difficult levels of maze to explore
  - Click-based navigation that stays within the bounds of the maze

Ideally this game will include the following items:
  - a loading screen with a number of options
  - scores based on the number of clicks it takes to navigate the maze
  - different player-character options
  - a leaderboard allowing users to see their scores compared to their previous tries and, hopefully, other player's tries as well.
