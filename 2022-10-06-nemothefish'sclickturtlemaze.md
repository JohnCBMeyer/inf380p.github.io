I made a maze that uses a go to function to help the turtle cross over. Started out with a rock, paper and scissors game but I couldn't figure out how to 
incoprate input in the game through clicking - not until it was too late at least. I have a problem visualizing a simple program and I think try to do too many things that I don't have the skill/time for right now. However I have learnt that drawing things or seeing other people's code helps me break things down in my head better than writing code from the get-go. For that reason, I need to give myself more time.
